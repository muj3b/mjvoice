# User Guide

Getting Started
- Launch the app (menubar mic icon appears).
- Default hotkey: Command+Option+Space.
- Press and hold to dictate; release to stop.

Preferences
- Offline Mode: enforce no network usage.
- Default Mode: Streaming, Instant, or Notes.
- Model Size: choose Tiny/Base/Small (if models installed).
- Tone Preset: Neutral/Professional/Friendly (local rules).

Dictation Modes
- Streaming: inserts text as recognized.
- Instant: buffers sentences, inserts when punctuation/pauses occur.
- Notes: directs output to scratchpad (future pane).

Privacy & Safety
- The app auto-pauses in secure fields (passwords) and never inserts text there.
- Mic access is requested on first use.

Troubleshooting
- If text doesn't insert, check Accessibility permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
- If dictation doesn't start, ensure no password field is focused and that the mic is available.
- If no text appears, verify CoreML Whisper models are installed at the expected path.
